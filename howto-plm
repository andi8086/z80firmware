**** COMPILE CP/M 2.2 SOURCES WITH PL/M 80 Version 4 ****

Use the ISIS-II emulator for DOS in DOSBOX and compile 'STAT.PLM':

Assuming the PLM80 compiler in :F1:, the ASM80 assembler in :F2:,
the linker etc in :F3: and the sources in :F0:, do the following:

os5trint.src has a filename which is apparently 1 character too long for ISIS,
rename it to os5tr.src.
This Assembler file contains the needed external references to BOOT,MON1,MON2,etc

On the ISIS prompt, type

:F1:ASM80 OS5TR.SRC
:F1:PLM80 STAT.PLM
:F3:LINK STAT.OBJ,OS5TR.OBJ,:F1:PLM80.LIB TO STAT.MOD
:F3:LOCATE STAT.MOD CODE(0100H) STACKSIZE(100)
:F3:OBJHEX STAT TO STAT.HEX
EXIT

In Linux, use objcopy to convert stat.hex to stat.rom

objcopy -I ihex -O binary STAT.HEX STAT.ROM

Use my addheader bash script to add the header for the FIFO loader

./addheader STAT.ROM 0x100

this will generate a STAT.bin

Reset the Z80 System and first load the RAM Loader (monitor.bin)

cat monitor.bin > /dev/ttyUSB0

Then load the program STAT.bin

cat STAT.bin > /dev/ttyUSB0
and press ENTER (any key except g, since we don't want to run it)

Now load CP/M which will not clear the stat binary program we just loaded to 0x100

cat cpm.bin > /dev/ttyUSB0

and press g to start CP/M.

Now store the program to disk with
stat.rom itself has a size of 0x13CE, which means it occupies 0x0100 - 0x14CE, giving
0x14 = 20 paragraphs to save, Hence

SAVE 20 STAT.COM

saves STAT.COM to disk. The definition in OS5TRINT.SRC contains the definition of MON1,
a link to FDOS, which is expected to be at memory location 0x0005 ( a jump to FBASE )
So, for the CP/M programs to work, the BIOS has to put 'JP FBASE' to memory location
0x0005 before starting CP/M. It should also put 'JP COMMAND' to 0x0000 to 'reboot'
CP/M after each program.
